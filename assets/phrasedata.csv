I'd offer: 'Fancies beget dreams, and idleness the midwife — such wraiths are born of minds adrift from waking purpose.'"
3075,"Ambition, the soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss than gain",56,He chased promotion so hard he misplaced lunch—and nearly Saturday.,John Webster,"Webster, mirror to man's darker soul, here shows ambition noble yet reckless.

3076,Security is mortal's chiefest enemy,30,"Forgot my PIN; security, thou silent assassin, struck at the till.",Christopher Marlowe,"Marlowe's Faustus learned this full bitterly. I would render it: 'When man feels safest, then creeps ruin softest — in pride's calm harbour lurks the storm.'"

3081,"Love's fire heats water, water cools not love",36,"She said love's a flame—I brought water, she brought my ex.",George Chapman,"Chapman hath it true: love's flame doth boil the sea, yet Neptune's tears ne'er tame its heat. I'd reframe it thus: 'Love, once kindled, doth burn the tide itself, and no flood may quench what passion lights.'"
3082,"We are time's subjects, and time bids be gone",35,Time's subjects? I work weekends and still can't afford guacamole.,Thomas Middleton,"Middleton sees time not as steward, but as tyrant. In my tongue: 'We serve Time's iron crown, and when he lifts his hand, we vanish like mist at morning.'"
3083,The dignity of truth is lost with much protesting,41,"Truth may wear velvet, but gossip struts in sequins.",Ben Jonson,Jonson's wit is sharp: protest doth oft betray falsehood. I'd say: 'Truth stands silent and firm; only lies do raise loud banners in defense.'
