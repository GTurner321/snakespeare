3066,The heart is never found in sounder man,Physician says my heart beats true; 'tis the group chat that frays it.,Francis Beaumont,"From The White Devil (c. 1612), by John Webster. Flamineo declares, ""We are only what we are remembered for,"" emphasizing legacy and reputation.

3070,What is done cannot be now amended,Fired off that rash tweet; no backspace can now mend it.,Thomas Kyd,"From The Revenger's Tragedy (c. 1606), likely by Thomas Middleton. Vindice says, ""When the bad bleeds, then is the tragedy good,"" celebrating vengeance. The line encapsulates the play's grotesque blend of justice and bloodshed, implying that only when the wicked suffer does the audience find catharsis."
3071,The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose,Even spam cites scripture—Satan must keep a social-media intern.,Christopher Marlowe,"From Volpone (1606), by Ben Jonson. Mosca quips, ""Who cannot be wise in a fair garden?"" The line ironically suggests that appearing virtuous is easy when surrounded by beauty and order. It critiques superficial morality and the ease with which people pretend virtue under favorable circumstances."
3072,I count religion but a childish toy,Debating theology on X? Children flinging rattles in a digital crib.,Christopher Marlowe,"From Volpone (1606), by Ben Jonson. Volpone declares, ""I glory more in the cunning purchase of my wealth than in the glad possession."" This reveals his pride not in riches themselves but in the deceitful methods used to acquire them. It underscores the play's satire of greed and trickery."
3073,Time is the old justice that examines all offenders,Overdue bills prove Father Time moonlights as a debt collector.,Ben Jonson,"From The Alchemist (1610), by Ben Jonson.

3075,"Ambition, the soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss than gain",He chased promotion so hard he misplaced lunch—and nearly Saturday.,John Webster,"From The Atheist's Tragedy (c. 1611), by Cyril Tourneur. The line ""Truth is truth to the end of reckoning"" is spoken with philosophical certainty.

3076,Security is mortal's chiefest enemy,"Forgot my PIN; security, thou silent assassin, struck at the till.",Christopher Marlowe,"From The Atheist's Tragedy (c. 1611), by Cyril Tourneur. The line ""It is a deed of darkness"" refers to a secretive or immoral act.

Simon Eyre joyfully exclaims, ""O, the brave trade of shoemaking!"" as he rises from humble cobbler to Lord Mayor.

3078,"My name is lost, by treason's tooth bare-gnawn",Autocorrect gnawed my name and spat me out anonymous.,John Fletcher,"From The Shoemaker's Holiday (1599), by Thomas Dekker. ""I am a gentleman! God be thanked!"" is Simon Eyre's gleeful claim. It reflects both the social comedy and Dekker's democratic optimism—that dignity and status can be earned rather than inherited."
3079,There's no clock to strike the hours of pain,Pain keeps its own clock: it chimes whenever I attempt yoga.,Thomas Middleton,"From The Honest Whore (1604), by Thomas Dekker and Thomas Middleton.

3081,"Love's fire heats water, water cools not love","She said love's a flame—I brought water, she brought my ex.",George Chapman,"From The Knight of the Burning Pestle (1607), by Francis Beaumont (with John Fletcher). The Citizen exclaims, ""Let him kill a lion with a pestle, husband!"" as he interrupts the play to demand absurdly heroic deeds. This meta-theatrical moment mocks audience expectations and satirizes chivalric romance."
3082,"We are time's subjects, and time bids be gone",Time's subjects? I work weekends and still can't afford guacamole.,Thomas Middleton,"From The Knight of the Burning Pestle (1607), by Francis Beaumont.

3084,Conscience is a word that cowards use,Cowards call it conscience; I call it a group chat read at 2am.,Thomas Kyd,"From Philaster (c. 1608–1610), by Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher. Bellario (Euphrasia in disguise) says, ""I wear a sword to save a friend.""

3085,A guilty conscience never feels secure,Conscience is that tiny voice you mute when temptation wears cologne.,John Fletcher,"From Women Beware Women (c. 1621), by Thomas Middleton. Livia says, ""Sin, in a woman, is double,"" reflecting societal double standards.

3090,Sweet are the uses of adversity,Joy arrived and said nothing. Tragedy came later and brought snacks.,John Fletcher,"From The Broken Heart (c. 1625–1633), by John Ford. Orgilus says, ""Justice is blind, and so am I,"" having blinded himself out of guilt and despair.
